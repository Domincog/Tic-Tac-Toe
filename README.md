# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple tic-tac-toe implementation using Python.

Possible future implimentations:

[] Prevent users from overiding each-others placements on tic-tac-toe board
[] Add a 'computer' for a player to play against
[] Make the tic-tac-toe game ask if players want to play again
[] Make code more legible (better comments / syntax)
